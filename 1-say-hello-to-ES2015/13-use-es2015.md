```
name: Use ES2015 with a Real Project?
bulletPackage: free
```

This is a great question.

Currently, none of the browsers have implemented the full specification of ES2015. In particular, a feature like ES2015 modules has not been implemented by any browser. So, it's nearly impossible to use ES2015 right now directly in browsers.

### So, what should I do?

**Welcome to the world of transpiling.**

This means that you write code in ES2015 and use a tool to convert ES2015 into ES5, which you can run anywhere. There are a few transpilers, but [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a popular one.

Setting up Babel is somewhat difficult and you need to have a bit of experience with it. That's where the following starter kits are going to help us.

* Use [node-base](https://github.com/kadirahq/node-base), if you need to work on a Node.js app.
* Use [npm-base](https://github.com/kadirahq/npm-base), if you are working on a NPM module.
* Use [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate) if you are working on a React app.

> Additionally, you can use [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), which supports ES2015 by default.
